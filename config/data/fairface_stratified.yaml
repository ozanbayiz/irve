# Configuration for FairFace Stratified Subsetting

# Columns to stratify on (from FairFace dataset features)
# Examples: ['race'], ['gender'], ['age'], ['race', 'gender']
stratify_columns: ['race', 'gender', 'age']

# Target number of samples per stratum in the training subset
target_samples_per_stratum_train: 100 # Adjust as needed

# Target number of samples per stratum in the validation/analysis subset
target_samples_per_stratum_val: 50   # Adjust as needed

# Seed for reproducible random sampling during stratification
random_seed: 42

# Path to save the intermediate subset references (e.g., indices)
# These will be created by prepare_fairface_subset and read by extract_florence_patches
subset_indices_dir: ${path.data_root}/subset_indices # Assumes path.data_root is defined
train_indices_file: ${.subset_indices_dir}/train_subset_indices.npy
